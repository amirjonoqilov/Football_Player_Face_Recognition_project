# Football Player Face Recognition Project

This project is designed to recognize football players by their facial images using computer vision techniques. The goal is to identify players based on a given image input, which can be useful for sports analytics, media applications, or fan engagement tools.

I was inspired to develop this project after watching a tutorial by the Codebasics YouTube channel. You can check out their video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWXXHjV3JHI&t=5s).
